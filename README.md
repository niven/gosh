# What is Gosh?

Gosh is a set of modules to make writing "shell scripts" in Go easier, especially when using Go in Github Action Runners.

# Why is it useful?

Github actions are a giant pile of unreadable YAML that contains Bash scripts. If you want to do anything in a GHA you need to interact with environment variables for input and output. This makes that easier.

# How users can get started with the project

Create a YAML file for a Github Action that runs a Go script. Check the examples directory.

# Where users can get help with your project

Contact me via Github.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project

Just me, this is something that is not releasable to the general public yet
